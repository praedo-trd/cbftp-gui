# Automated tasks 

TRD comes with some CLI tools out the box which you can configure to do a few things.

Run `php app/console.php` to find out how to run them.

- `trd:preload_data`  Uses third-party sources to try and pre-cache data provider information
- `trd:cbftp` Attempts to display the credits in the web gui for each of your sites.
